===========

When we are in a project, we need to make plans, there are usually two ways to do it: The first is to use a software like `Microsoft Project`, this kind of software have rich features, but there is one downside which I don't like: they are too heavy, it is different to embbed the project plan into a text file like `Markdown` file; The second is to utilize the table syntax to write the plan directly in a markdown file. Personally I prefer the second approach: it is pure text, you do not rely on any special app to display it; It also has its downside, it is hard to maintain:

* If you want to change the scheduled time for on of the tasks, you need to re-schedule all the tasks after it.
* You can not see all the resource usage for the whole project like what `Microsoft Project` did.
* You cann't filter the tasks according to some perticually critera.

This tiny software is to solve the above issues.

## Currently we support the following features

* [Auto-Schedule](#usage)
* [Track task progress](#track-task-progress)
* [Filter by prople](#filter-by-people)
* [Trackvacation](#track-vacation)
* [Break big tasks](#break-big-tasks)
* [Scheduler UI](#scheduler-ui)


## Scheduler Command Line

### Basic Usage

```bash
scheduler.py [-m <man>] -e /path/to/work-breakdown-file.markdown
```

The input file for the command line tool is a `markdown` file(see test_en.markdown for an example), you can define the tasks of your project in a file, e.g.

```bash
# Task basic info
* ProjectStartDate: 2014-08-21

# task breakdown
* task1 -- 2[James]
* task2 -- 1[Lucy]
* task3 -- 1[James]
* task4 -- 2[Lucy]
```

The above file defines that the project starts from `2014-08-21`, and defines the tasks of the project, now run the following command, we get an auto-scheduled project plan(If you use a Fixed-Width Font you will find that the table generated is well aligned)

```bash
> ./scheduler.py -e /tmp/test.markdown
Task  | Developer  | Man-days | Start Date | End Date   | Progress
----- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----
task1 | James      | 2.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-22 | 0%
task2 | Lucy       | 1.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-21 | 0%
task3 | James      | 1.0      | 2014-08-25 | 2014-08-25 | 0%
task4 | Lucy       | 2.0      | 2014-08-22 | 2014-08-25 | 0%

>> Total mandays: 6.0, Finished mandays: 0.00, Progress: 0.00%
```

You may have already noticed that if you save the output into a `markdown` file, the content is actually a table. i.e. **You only need to maintain the task list and how much time every task takes, this software will auto-schedule the plan for you.

## Track task progress

As time flies, you need to update the status of each task, we support to update the status in the task `breakdown` file, e.g.

```bash
# Task basic info
* ProjectStartDate: 2014-08-21

# task breakdown
* task1 -- 2[James][100%]
* task2 -- 1[Lucy][80%]
* task3 -- 1[James]
* task4 -- 2[Lucy]
```

re-run the command, you get a new **updated** plan:

```bash
>  ./scheduler.py -e /tmp/test.markdown
Task  | Developer  | Man-days | Start Date | End Date   | Progress
----- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----
task1 | James      | 2.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-22 | 100%
task2 | Lucy       | 1.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-21 | 80%
task3 | James      | 1.0      | 2014-08-25 | 2014-08-25 | 0%
task4 | Lucy       | 2.0      | 2014-08-22 | 2014-08-25 | 0%

>> Total mandays: 6.0, Finished mandays: 0.00, Progress: 46.67%
```

## Filter tasks by people

If you want to check out all the tasks assigned to `James`, add a `-m` param:

```bash
> ./scheduler.py -m James /tmp/test.markdown
Task  | Developer  | Man-days | Start Date | End Date   | Progress
----- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----
task1 | James      | 2.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-22 | 0%
task3 | James      | 1.0      | 2014-08-25 | 2014-08-25 | 0%

>> Total mandays: 6.0, Finished mandays: 0.00, Progress: 0.00%
```

### Track Vacation

During a project, it is almost inevitable that someone will ask for leave for some time, but the plan is already scheduled? how? re-schedule the plan manually? No! Just record the vacation record(take a look at the `vacation` section):

```bash
# Task basic info
* ProjectStartDate: 2014-08-21

# task breakdown
* task1 -- 2[James][100%]
* task2 -- 1[Lucy][80%]
* task3 -- 1[James]
* task4 -- 2[Lucy]

# vacations
* James -- 2014-08-22
```

re-run the command again, we get the following plan: 

```bash
> ./scheduler.py -e -m James /tmp/test.markdown
Task  | Developer  | Man-days | Start Date | End Date   | Progress
----- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----
task1 | James      | 2.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-25 | 100%
task3 | James      | 1.0      | 2014-08-26 | 2014-08-26 | 0%

>> Total mandays: 6.0, Finished mandays: 0.00, Progress: 46.67%
```

## Break big tasks

Sometimes we may encounter this kind of issue: A task is made up of several small tasks. e.g. If we are developing an online shopping website, we might have several tasks related with product: Create, Update, Delete, Retrieve, and we want to group these related task together:

```bash
# Task basic info
* ProjectStartDate: 2014-08-21

# Basic
* task1 -- 2[James][100%]
* task2 -- 1[Lucy][80%]
* task3 -- 1[James]
* task4 -- 2[Lucy]

## Product
* Create -- 2[James]
* Delete -- 1[Lucy]
* Update -- 1[James]
* Retrieve -- 2[Lucy]

# vacations
* James -- 2014-08-22
```

re-run the command(with a new option: `-t`) we get:

```bash
> ./scheduler.py -e -t /tmp/test.md
Task                   | Developer  | Man-days | Start Date | End Date   | Progress
---------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----
Basic-task1            | James      | 2.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-25 | 100%
Basic-task2            | Lucy       | 1.0      | 2014-08-21 | 2014-08-21 | 80%
Basic-task3            | James      | 1.0      | 2014-08-26 | 2014-08-26 | 0%
Basic-task4            | Lucy       | 2.0      | 2014-08-22 | 2014-08-25 | 0%
Basic-Product-Create   | James      | 2.0      | 2014-08-27 | 2014-08-28 | 0%
Basic-Product-Delete   | Lucy       | 1.0      | 2014-08-26 | 2014-08-26 | 0%
Basic-Product-Update   | James      | 1.0      | 2014-08-29 | 2014-08-29 | 0%
Basic-Product-Retrieve | Lucy       | 2.0      | 2014-08-27 | 2014-08-28 | 0%

>> Total mandays: 12.0, Finished mandays: 0.00, Progress: 23.33%
```
